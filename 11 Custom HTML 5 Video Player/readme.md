# Custom HTML 5 Video Player

In this project we built a custom HTML 5 video features on top of the basic features that are not modifiable. These features include : a play button, progress bar that can scrub, a volume and a speed range sliders, 25s skip forward and 10s skip back buttons, and lastly an fullscreen button.

## Notes

#### Events
* `play`
* `pause`
* `change`
* `timeupdate`
* `mousemove`
* `mousedown`
* `mouseup`
#### Properties
* `textCotent`
* `dataset`
* `currentTime`


#### Methods

## Logic

the project is set up in 3 parts: 
* Gathering our elements. 
* Setting up the functionality of that element through a specific function. 
* Hooking up that functionality to the appropriate event handler, triggered when interacting with the feature.
