# Whack A Mole Game

In this final project we made a whack mole game.

### Notes

#### isTrusted

The click event is important in determining the outcome of our game, therefore we need to protect from falsely initiating them via scripts or other modifications.

Using the `isTrusted` property allows you to ensure the event was generated by an actual user clicking.
```javascript
if (!event.isTrusted) return; // Wena ! stop cheating
```
#### Recursion

Since we have 1 out of 6 chances for a hole to show, we need to prevent scenarios where the same hole will be returned twice in a row by our `randomHole` function.

we need to save a reference of the last hole that was displayed in a variable: `lastHole` and then set a conditional statement to test for 
`hole === lastHole`; if true then we need run the `randomHole` function again to get another hole.

```javascript
let lastHole;

function randomHole(holes) {
    const idx = Math.floor(Math.random() * holes.length);
    const hole = holes[idx];

    if (lastHole === hole) {
        return randomHole(holes);
    }

    lastHole = hole;
    return hole;
}
```

### Logic

 Our game will revolves around 5 functions:

* a function that generates a random interval of time `randomTime`
* a function that returns a random hole each time its called `startGame`
* one that enables the moles to pop up `peep`
* one that allows us to start the game `startGame`
* one that allows to "whack" a mole when we click on it, keep track of our points and display them `bonk`
