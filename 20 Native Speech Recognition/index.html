// 1 SpeechRecognition is a global variable that lives in the browser on top of the window object.
  window.SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
// now we need to create other instances of that SpeechRecognition
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
// the we take this recognition constant and set the interimResults property. When set to true as you are speaking your speech is going populate in the browser, if you didnt apply the method you would have need to stop speaking before it prepopulates. When looking through our developer tools we see it creates a new paragraph after we stop speaking
recognition.interimResults = true;
//2 creating the functionality to build our paragraphs
let p = document.createElement('p');
const words = document.querySelector('.words');
words.appendChild(p);
//3 works the same as 'clicks'. We take our recognition constant and add an eventlistener listening for 'results'
recognition.addEventListener('result', e => {
  console.log(e.results);
  // in our developer tools we take the nested elements from our SpeechRecognition event and convert into a plain old string that we can see.e.results need to be converted into an array 1st so that we can use .map() on it
  const transcript = Array.from(e.results)
    .map(result => result[0])
    .map(result => result.transcript)
    .join('')
    //
    p.textContent = transcript;
    // at this point we see what we are saying in the dom but it keeps getting over written everytime we speak, because if we stop speaking transcript runs again and replaces our previous speach. So we need to check if the results are final
    if(e.results[0].isFinal){
      p = document.createElement('p');
      words.appendChild(p);
    }
    console.log(transcript);
});
//5 if you stop speaking and start speaking again its stops working and thats because we are listening for the 'results' event and when we stop speaking it just unbinds itself. So we need to set up another event listener for the 'end' event run recognition.start again.
recognition.addEventListener('end',recognition.start);
//4 dont want to run on page load
recognition.start();
