# 14 Must Know Dev Tool Tricks 
On this project we learned a couple helpful developer tool tricks

* `Console.log('Konbanwa')` --> logs regular string or variable into the console
* `Console.log('hello I am a %s string!', `:monkey_face:)--> Interporlated way
* `Console.warn('Cuidado !!!')`: display warning in the console
* `Console.error('it was at this moment he knew... he fucked up')`: display Error message
* `Console.info(`:scroll:`)`: display some information
* `Console.assert(p.classList.contains('something'),'that is wrong')` : Writes an error message to the console if the assertion is false. If the assertion is true, nothing happens.
* `Console.clear()`: Just clear all content in the console.
* `Console.dir()`: Displays an interactive list of the properties of the specified JavaScript object. The output is presented as a hierarchical listing with disclosure triangles that let you see the contents of child objects.
* `Console.groupCollapsed`: Creates a new inline group in the Web Console. Unlike console.group(), however, the new group is created collapsed. The user will need to use the disclosure button next to it to expand it, revealing the entries created in the group.
* `Console.groupEnd: Exits the current inline group in the Web Console.`
* `Console.count(`:point_up:` `:v:` `:raised_hand:`)`: Logs the number of times that this particular call to count() has been called.
* `Console.time(`:watch:`)`: Starts a timer you can use to track how long an operation takes. You give each timer a unique name, and may have up to 10,000 timers running on a given page. 
* `Console.timeEnd()`: Stops a timer that was previously started by calling console.time(). When you call console.timeEnd() with the same name as console.time(), the browser will output the time, in milliseconds, that elapsed since the timer was started.
* `Console.table()`: Displays tabular data as a table.
This function takes one mandatory argument data, which must be an array or an object
